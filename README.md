# Hate_Speech_Detection_MMAI_894
 This project is going to leverage Deep Learing Technique such as NLP, Embedings, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, Transfer Learning etc to detect hate speech.

### Summary of the Dataset: Hate Speech Data
Contributors viewed short text and identified if it a) contained hate speech, b) was offensive but without hate speech, or c) was not offensive at all. Contains nearly 15K rows with three contributor judgments per text string.
